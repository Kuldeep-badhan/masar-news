          Thank you for visiting the news website of Masdar, part of Mubadala
          Investment Company. By accessing this website (the “Website”), you
          agree to follow the terms and conditions set out on this page (the
          “Terms of Use”). Please read them carefully.
        </p>
        <strong>Use the Website Appropriately</strong>
        <p>
          Use our Website the way it is meant to be used. That is, don’t try to
          interfere with its security features, stop other people from accessing
          it, or damage or vandalise the information on it. We take these
          matters seriously and will refer them to law enforcement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything on our Website is protected by copyright law. Accessing and
          viewing the content we provide to you does not give you any ownership
          of it, or rights to it. This means that you can’t use content you find
          on our Website in any way unless you get written permission from the
          person that owns it, which in most cases is Masdar. That includes
          logos, charts, and pictures as well as any text on the Website or in a
          file we provide on the Website.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to request permission to use something from our Website,
          you can contact us here masdarcity@masdar.ae . We’ll do our best to
          get back to you quickly and accommodate your request. If the content
          you want to use is owned by someone else, we’ll let you know that as
          well.
        </p>
        <strong>Content on the Website</strong>
        <p>
          Most of the content on the Website belongs to Masdar. Some of the
          content we provide, however, may come from other sources. Content on
          our Website that is not provided by Masdar is the sole responsibility
          of the person or group that provided that content. If you’re not sure
          if a specific piece of content is being provided by Mubadala or some
          other party, contact us and we’ll let you know.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we provide you with content not owned by Masdar, either on our
          Website or in a link to another website not owned by Masdar, it is
          because we want to provide you with information that might be relevant
          to your interests in Masdar. It does not mean that the views in this
          content are Masdar’s. Likewise, if we reference a company, product, or
          service that is not provided by Masdar on our Website, it is intended
          to be informative and does not mean that Masdar endorses or recommends
          it.
        </p>
        <strong>What We Collect from You When You Visit the Website</strong>
        <p>
          We collect two kinds of information from you when you visit the
          Website.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we collect any information you voluntarily provide to us. For
          example, if you fill out the web form on our “Contact Us” page, we
          collect that information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, we automatically collect some information from you that’s
          related to how you’re accessing the Website. For example, we collect
          the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the domain you use to access the
          internet, the date and time you access our site, the pages you visit,
          and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked
          directly to our site, as well as other similar features that are
          useful to us in providing the best possible content to you. This
          information is not shared with anyone beyond the support staff for
          this website, except when required by law or other law enforcement
          authorities, and is used only as a source of anonymous statistical
          information.
        </p>
        <strong>Limitation of Our Liability</strong>
        <p>
          We provide the Website to you on an “as is” basis. We don’t give you
          any warranties or guarantees about how the Website will work, the
          availability of the Website, or whether you can get results from the
          Website. Likewise, none of the third parties that provide any of the
          content on the Website give you any warranties about how it will work,
          its availability, or any results you can get from it.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Any liability related to the quality and performance of the Website,
          or the accuracy or completeness of the content on the Website, belongs
          to you. We are not liable for any acts or damages that arise out of
          your use of the Website in any way. We aren’t liable for any acts or
          damages that arise out of your inability to use the Website in any
          way. Likewise, none of the third parties that provide any of the
          content on the Website are liable for any acts or damages that arise
          out of your use, or inability to use, the Website either.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you violate the Terms of Use and another person or entity brings a
          legal claim against Masdar, its affiliates, or their respective
          officers, directors, owners, agents, information providers, or
          copyright owners (together, the “Masdar Parties”) as a result of your
          violation, you are required to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
          the Masdar Parties for that legal claim.
        </p>
        <strong>About These Terms of Use</strong>
        <p>
          By using the Website, you agree to the Terms of Use on this page. If
          you don’t agree with these Terms of Use, don’t use the Website. We may
          change these Terms of Use from time to time, so please check this page
          regularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to end your use of the Website at any time, for
          any reason, without notice or liability to us. If you violate any of
          the Terms of Use, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t
          mean we accept your conduct or agree to not take action in the future.
          If there is any dispute between you and Masdar about or related to the
          Terms of Use, the laws of the United Arab Emirates (and, as
          applicable, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi) will apply to the dispute. If
          there is any dispute, it will be settled before the Abu Dhabi civil
          courts. Of course, if you break the law by attempting to tamper with
          or disrupt the Website, that will be handled by law enforcement and
          the criminal courts.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any questions about the Terms of Use, contact us here
          contact@masdar.ae and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can.
